#### Sliding window + Left/Right Two Pointers
- https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/solution/
- Start with DFS thought, but realize redundant calculations: 
    - we never need to flip 2 indexes [A], [C] from 0 -> 1, if there is a [B] in middle that is 0 too
    - the flipped k zeroes must be consecutive too
- we can utilize two pointers to establish a window that captures k zeroes
    - always expend right pointer; if seeing an zero, k--
        - note: `len = right - left + 1` is the ongoing max length
    - when k < 0 (too many zeros), we need to slide the left side of the window to make sure:
        - keep window len 
        - potentially do k++ when A[left]==0
- goal: matain a max size of the window, until right  == n
- return (right - left). at this moment, right == n, so no need to (right - left + 1)

/*
Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 20000
0 <= K <= A.length
A[i] is 0 or 1
