- Method1 and Method2 are identical to `159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters`. 
- However, time complexity for Method2 in increases to O(nk). https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/solution/
- we want to do better than that (Method3)

#### Method1: Slinding Window, Two Pointers: move 1 element at a time
- Typical slinding window: the goal is to keep a distinct char size/window of size 2.
- use a map<char, count> to track; map.size() is the window size. Follow the template
    - 1) move right pointer, and update freq count map
    - 2) if map.size() == k, process and record max len
    - 3) if map.size() > k, maintain window size: drop curr left char, update map
- return max
- time: O(n)
- space: O(k)

#### Method2: Sliding window, Two Pointer: truncate the entire block at a time
- record last occurance index in map<char, index>
    - when size goes over limit, find last occurance of left-most element
    - set left = leftMostIndex + 1. 
    - This truncates entire block before the last occurance of left-most element
- sliding window 的切割: 用hashmap 存 last occurrance of char index; 
- map.remove(c) 之后, 就等于彻底切掉了那一段; 那么 map.get(c) + 1 也就是新的 left window border
- time: O(nk) to find the left-most element
- space: O(k)

#### Method3: Sliding window + LinkedHashMap
- https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/solution/
- as mentioned above, Method2 uses O(nk), because it takes O(k) to find head item that was inserted first
    - meanwhile, we still need the hash map feature to get/put/remove last occurance of a char with O(1)
- Solution: use a LinkedHashMap: 
    - `map.entrySet().iterator()` maintains the insertion order!
- Special handling:
    - since we want the `lastOccurMap` to preserve laset insertion order
    - we need to `remove` the char every time before put.
- time: O(n)
- space: O(k)
