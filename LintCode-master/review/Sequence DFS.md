**0. [Strobogrammatic Number II.java](https://github.com/awangdev/LintCode/blob/master/Java/Strobogrammatic%20Number%20II.java)**      Level: Medium      Tags: [DFS, Enumeration, Math, Sequence DFS]
      
TODO: 
1. use list, iterative? keep candidates and populating
2. clean up the dfs code, a bit messy
3. edge case of "0001000" is invalid, right?

#### DFS
- A bit like BFS solution: find inner list, and then combine with outter left/right sides.
- find all solutions, DFS will be easier to write than iterative/BFS
- when n = 1, there can be list of candidates at bottom of the tree, so bottom->up is better
- bottom->up, dfs till leaf level, and return candidates.
- each level, pair with all the candidates
- 其实就是剥皮，一层一层，是一个central-depth-first的，钻到底时候，return n=1,或者n=2的case，然后开始backtracking。
- 难的case先不handle.到底之后来一次overall scan.
- every level have 5 choices of digital pairs to add on sides. Need to do for n-2 times. 
- Time complexity: O(5^n)

**1. [22. Generate Parentheses.java](https://github.com/awangdev/LintCode/blob/master/Java/22.%20Generate%20Parentheses.java)**      Level: Medium      Tags: [Backtracking, DFS, Sequence DFS, String]
      

#### DFS
- start with empty string, need to go top->bottom
- 取或者不取`(`, `)`
- rule: open parentheses >= close parentheses
- Note: 在DFS时 pass a reference (StringBuffer) and maintain, instead of passing object (String) and re-create every time
- time: O(2^n), pick/not pick, the decision repat for all nodes at every level
- time: T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + O(1) = O(2^n)
- space: < than 2^n results = O(2^n)

#### bottom->up DFS
- figure out n=1, n=2 => build n=3, and n=4
- dfs(n-1) return a list of candidates
- add a pair of `()` to the candidates: either in front, at end, or contain the candidates
