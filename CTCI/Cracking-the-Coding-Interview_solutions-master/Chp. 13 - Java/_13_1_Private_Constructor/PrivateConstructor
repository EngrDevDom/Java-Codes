If a class, A, has a private constructor, this prevents other classes from inheriting from A.

Exceptions: 
    - If A has an inner class, that class has access to A's private constructor, so it can inherit from A
    - If A is an inner class of another class, Q, then Q's other inner classes can inherit from A
